🚀 Key Features
Full 3D Environment: A complete, interactive 3D scene rendered with Three.js.

Camera Controls: Smooth orbital controls allow users to pan, zoom, and rotate around the solar system.

Interactive Planets: Users can click on any planet to trigger a smooth "fly-to" camera animation.

Detailed Planet View: After flying to a planet, a UI overlay displays its name, description, and key statistics (diameter, mass, temperature, etc.).

Accurate Orbits & Rotations: Planets orbit the sun at different speeds and rotate on their own axes, creating a dynamic and realistic simulation.

Stunning Visuals: Features include a starfield background, planetary orbits, lighting effects, and Saturn's rings.

Responsive UI: The user interface, built with Tailwind CSS, adapts gracefully to different screen sizes.

💻 Tech Stack
This project leverages a powerful combination of modern web technologies to create its immersive experience:

Three.js: The core 3D library used for rendering the scene, planets, orbits, and handling camera controls.

Tailwind CSS: For all user interface elements, ensuring a clean, modern, and responsive design.

HTML5 & CSS3: For the foundational structure and custom styling.

JavaScript (ES6 Modules): For all the logic, including scene setup, animation loops, user interactions, and data management.
